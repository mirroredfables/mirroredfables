Instead, each line served as an element in a complex formula designed to alter my own perception.\n[Narrator] I became aware of a presence watching me from behind; as if sensing my fear, it whispered:\n[Presence] \"You have discovered what others have sought for centuries by reading not with your mind but with your very essence. Now you must choose: become one with the knowledge you seek or remain trapped within these pages.\""
