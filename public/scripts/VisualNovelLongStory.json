  "previewText": "[Narrator] Coy gazes, stolen glances, secret smiles,\nAll by the moonlight’s soft embrace concealed;\nTorn by desire, hope and fear beguiled,\nGathering courage, my heart longs to yield.\nIn shadows, rivals loom, those I must sway,\nRemove, so none can stand between us two;\nLove's game I'll play, I'll make them rue the day,\nVowing to win this heart that I pursue.\nIn shadows, I must wear a clever guise,\nLies spun like silk, a web to catch my prize;\nLament, my love, for truth's a fleeting wraith,\nIn the end, you'll see, deceit is love's true face.\nAnd when I've bested all who dare compete,\nNow, we shall join, our fates entwined complete.",
