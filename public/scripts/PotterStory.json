Each wand imbibes wisdom from its owner, much as each owner absorbs wisdom from their chosen wand.\n[Narrator] As they explore the alley's fantastical wares, fate entwines Aurelia's path with another, most delicately poised.\n[Caspian] (sneering) If it isn't Aurelia Potter, the girl expected to trump us all.\n[Aurelia] And you must be Caspian Malfoy, the boy forever chained to his family's past.\n[Caspian] We'll see, Potter. We'll see who triumphs at Hogwarts.\n[Narrator] Elsewhere in the throng of eldritch delights, an equally radiant soul catches Aurelia's eye.\n[Iris] Aurelia, my dear cousin! Are you as filled with awe and wonder as I?\n[Aurelia] Truly, Iris! I anticipate that our first year at Hogwarts will be nothing short of spectacular.\n[Narrator] What began as a pursuit of the mundane - the acquisition of wise tomes and enchanted quills - now teeters upon the precipice of destiny. Aurelia's future entwined with the threads of her heritage, shimmering just beyond her grasp.\n[Aurelia] Mother, Father, I promise to stay true to our family legacy, to honor the memory of those who came before, and to forge my own path in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts.\n[Mr. and Mrs. Potter] (proudly) We know you will, Aurelia.\n[Narrator] With oaths taken and hearts set alight, Aurelia takes the first step on a journey that will determine her fate, and perhaps the fate of the Four Magical Realms."
